# NATS JetStream Integration for NestJS - Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for the NATS JetStream integration with NestJS microservices. The integration provides a custom transport strategy for NestJS applications to communicate using NATS JetStream, a persistent streaming system built on top of NATS.

## Key Goals
1. Provide seamless integration between NestJS microservices and NATS JetStream
2. Support both message patterns (request-response) and event patterns (publish-subscribe)
3. Ensure proper handling of NATS connections, including reconnection and error handling
4. Maintain compatibility with NestJS's microservices architecture
5. Provide a simple and intuitive API for developers
6. Support configuration through both direct options and NestJS's ConfigService

## Functional Requirements

### Connection Management
- Connect to NATS servers with configurable options
- Support multiple server addresses for high availability
- Handle reconnection automatically
- Provide proper connection status updates and logging
- Support graceful shutdown and connection draining

### Stream and Consumer Management
- Create and manage JetStream streams
- Create and manage durable consumers
- Support various delivery and replay policies
- Handle stream and consumer errors appropriately

### Message Handling
- Support publishing messages to NATS subjects
- Support subscribing to NATS subjects
- Handle message acknowledgment (ack, nack, term)
- Support message encoding and decoding (JSON by default)
- Provide context information for message handlers

### NestJS Integration
- Implement CustomTransportStrategy for server-side integration
- Extend ClientProxy for client-side integration
- Support both static and async module registration
- Integrate with NestJS's dependency injection system
- Support NestJS's message pattern and event pattern paradigms

## Technical Constraints
- Maintain compatibility with NestJS versions 9, 10, and 11
- Require Node.js version 18 or higher
- Use NATS client library version 2.x
- Support TypeScript for type safety
- Minimize external dependencies
- Ensure proper error handling and logging
- Provide comprehensive test coverage

## Performance Requirements
- Minimize latency for message processing
- Support high throughput for message publishing and consumption
- Efficiently handle connection pooling
- Minimize memory footprint

## Extensibility
- Allow for custom codec implementations
- Support custom consumer options
- Provide hooks for extending functionality
- Design for future enhancements and additional features
